Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance
of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality,
consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as
analysis and machine learning. Data engineering is the intersection of
security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration,
and software engineering. A data engineer manages the data engineering
lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending
with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.

The data engineering lifecycle also has a notion of undercurrents—critical
ideas across the entire lifecycle. These include security, data management,
DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. 

 a data engineer juggles a lot of
complex moving parts and must constantly optimize along the axes of cost,
agility, scalability, simplicity, reuse, and interoperability 

3 STAGES OF COMPANIES WITH DATA 

- STARTING WITH DATA 

  A data engineer should focus on the following in organizations getting
  started with data:
  - Get buy-in from key stakeholders, including executive management.
  Ideally, the data engineer should have a sponsor for critical initiatives
  to design and build a data architecture to support the company’s goals.
  - Define the right data architecture (usually solo, since a data architect
  likely isn’t available). This means determining business goals and the
  competitive advantage you’re aiming to achieve with your data
  initiative. Work toward a data architecture that supports these goals.
  - Identify and audit data that will support key initiatives and operate
  within the data architecture you designed.
  - Build a solid data foundation for future data analysts and data
  scientists to generate reports and models that provide competitive
  value. In the meantime, you may also have to generate these reports
  and models until this team is hired.
  - Get and talk to people 


- SCALING WITH DATA 

  In organizations that are in stage 2 of data maturity, a data engineer’s goals
  are to do the following:
  - Establish formal data practices
  - Create scalable and robust data architectures
  - Adopt DevOps and DataOps practices
  - Build systems that support ML
  - Continue to avoid undifferentiated heavy lifting and customize onlywhen a competitive advantage results


- LEADING WITH DATA 

  n organizations in stage 3 of data maturity, a data engineer will continue
  building on prior stages, plus they will do the following:
  - Create automation for the seamless introduction and usage of new data
  - Focus on building custom tools and systems that leverage data as acompetitive advantage
  - Focus on the “enterprisey” aspects of data, such as data management(including data governance and quality) and DataOps
  - Deploy tools that expose and disseminate data throughout the organization, including data catalogs, data lineage tools, and metadata management systems
  - Collaborate efficiently with software engineers, ML engineers, analysts, and others
  - Create a community and environment where people can collaborate and speak openly, no matter their role or position

Data engineering is a holistic practice; the best data engineers view their responsibilities through business and technical lenses.
